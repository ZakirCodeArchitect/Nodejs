## Features

- **RESTful API**: Implements REST principles with CRUD operations.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling using Express middleware.
- **Database Integration**: Works with a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
- **Logging**: Logs important application events (e.g., requests, errors).
- **Input Validation**: Uses `Joi` or `Validator.js` for request validation.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** v14.x - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
- **Express.js:** Fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL (customize based on your project).
- **JWT (JSON Web Token):** Authentication via token-based security.
- **Nodemailer:** Sending emails from your application.
- **Mongoose/Sequelize:** ODM/ORM for working with the database.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables the execution of JavaScript on the server-side, making it possible to build backend applications using JavaScript. Node.js is highly performant, event-driven, and designed for building scalable network applications.

### Key Advantages of Node.js:

- **Non-blocking I/O:** Handles multiple operations concurrently with an event loop, allowing for high performance even under heavy load.
- **Single Programming Language:** Write both client-side and server-side code using JavaScript.
- **Community and Ecosystem:** Rich ecosystem with a huge collection of libraries and modules available via npm (Node Package Manager).
- **Scalability:** Ideal for building scalable network applications (e.g., microservices, real-time applications).

### Use Cases for Node.js:

- **API Servers**: Ideal for building RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Perfect for chat apps, live updates, etc.
- **Microservices**: Excellent for building scalable and modular systems.
- **IoT**: Frequently used in developing Internet of Things systems due to its event-driven nature.

## Core Concepts of Node.js

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

Node.js operates on an event-driven architecture, utilizing an event loop that continuously listens for events (e.g., I/O events). When an event occurs, Node.js calls the corresponding callback function.

Example:
```javascript
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
});
